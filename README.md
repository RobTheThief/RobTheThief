Being creative while making something that behaves like a machine and giving it
life has been one of the most satisfying things I have ever done. Taking the
logical reasoning learned through working as an IT Technician and a renaissance
education, and creativity fostered through music, art and writing, for me software
development is the perfect expression for both.
